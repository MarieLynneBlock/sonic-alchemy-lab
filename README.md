## Sound Analysis Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed for the analysis of sound waves, audio, and music. The notebooks aim to facilitate research and development in Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Music Information Retrieval (MIR), and other sound-related fields. These tools are suitable for AI experts, data scientists, and engineers with a focus on audio signal processing.

## Introduction

The Sound Analysis Notebooks provide a comprehensive suite of tools for analysing various aspects of sound and music. These notebooks cover topics ranging from basic waveform analysis to advanced MIR techniques. The goal is to offer an accessible platform for both educational and professional purposes, promoting the synergy between science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Recommended: Anaconda distribution for simplified package management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sound-analysis-notebooks.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sound-analysis-notebooks
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start using the notebooks:

1. Activate the virtual environment if not already activated:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open and run the desired notebook from the Jupyter interface.
